QML tutorial
set order - elements drawn later are on top
order of qml properties doesn't matter. 

todo:
 - line drawing... done in the canvas. Test will compare final canvas coordinate to the turtle test to make sure it's accurate (must end at same position)
 - vector of lines is sent to painter to draw. 
 - don't calculate if pen is up
 - where to place the connection between the turtle and the actual drawing... Put a connection in turtle constructor i guess.
